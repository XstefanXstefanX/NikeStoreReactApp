      <h1>Animals</h1>
      <h3>Pink Floyd album</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Animals is the tenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd,
        released on 21 January 1977[2] through Harvest Records and Columbia
        Records. It was self-produced at Pink Floyd's Britannia Row Studios in
        London throughout 1976. The album continued the long-form compositions
        that made up their previous works, including Wish You Were Here (1975).

        Animals is both a progressive rock album and a concept album, focusing
        on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain, and was a
        change from the style of Pink Floyd's work. Tension within the band
        during production culminated in keyboardist Richard Wright's being fired
        two years later. The album's cover, conceived by the band's bassist and
        lead songwriter Roger Waters and designed by long-time collaborator
        Storm Thorgerson, shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys
        of Battersea Power Station.

        Pink Floyd released no singles from Animals but promoted it through the
        In the Flesh tour. Waters' agitation with audiences during this tour
        inspired their next album, The Wall (1979). Animals reached number 2 in
        the UK and number 3 in the US. It initially received mixed reviews, but
        gained more favourable reviews in later years, and is considered one of
        the band's best works.

        In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey block of church halls at 35
        Britannia Row in Islington, north London. Their deal with Harvest
        Records' parent company EMI for unlimited studio time in return for a
        reduced percentage of sales had expired, and they converted the building
        into a recording studio and storage facility. Its construction took up
        most of 1975, and in April 1976 the band started work on their tenth
        studio album, Animals, at the new facility.[3][4]

        Animals was engineered by a previous Floyd collaborator, Brian
        Humphries,[3] and recording took place at Britannia Row from April to
        December 1976, continuing into early 1977.[5] "Raving and Drooling" and
        "You've Got to Be Crazy", two songs previously performed live and
        considered for Wish You Were Here, reappeared as "Sheep" and "Dogs"
        respectively.[3] They were reworked to fit the new concept, and
        separated by a Waters-penned composition, "Pigs (Three Different Ones)".
